<div class="container">
    <h1 class="title is-1">Checkout</h1>
    <h1>Rent Game {{guid}}?</h1>
    <button class="button is-success">Yes, Rent Now!</button>
    <p>This is where I left off - I sent the guid to the checkout component, and needed to make another call to the api for the unique game and its info to create a better checkout page. From here I would have cleaned up the CSS and layout.</p>
</div>
